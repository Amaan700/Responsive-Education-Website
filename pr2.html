            <p class="Subsectiontag">Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education system, which
                fall under the command of the government at three levels: federal, state and local. Under various
                articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act,
                2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The
                approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. Major policy initiatives in
                Indian education are numerous. Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined
                legally by each of India’s constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made
                education a ‘concurrent subject’. From this point on the central and state governments shared formal
                responsibility for funding and administration of education.</p>

            <p class="Subsectiontag">In pre-agrarian cultures, children learnt by following their instinct to play.
                There was no need for enforced education.[4] In agrarian cultures, the skills of agriculture, husbandry,
                bartering, and building skills can be passed on from adults to children or master to apprentice.
                Societies agree on the need for their children to learn and absorb their cultural traditions and beliefs
                and they attempt to do this informally in the family, or by gathering the children together and
                employing one adult to handle the task, a tutor. This worked well for the landowners, but the children
                of the landless would be employed from the age of seven as servants. In one source from the turn of the
                15th century, a French count advised that nobles' huntsmen should "choose a boy servant as young as
                seven or eight" and that "...this boy should be beaten until he has a proper dread of failing to carry
                out his masters orders." The document listed chores that the boy would perform daily, and that the boy
                would sleep in a loft above the kennels in order to attend to the hounds' needs</p>

            <p class="Subsectiontag">With artificial intelligence, technology is increasingly involved in education. New
                digital competencies and media literacies call for a gender transformative approach (promoting gender
                equality, sharing control of resources and decision-making and women's empowerment) to the digitization
                and use of artificial intelligence (AI).Unlocking digital barriers through open educational resources
                enables global online learning and facilitate Education For All.Media and communication students will
                require ethics courses to establish their critical thinking skills and training. This will be crucial in
                a ‘fake news’ era when trust in media professionals is being eroded, especially when news and
                documentary production is impacted by the capacity of AI to manufacture authentic-looking ‘fake’
                material. For instance, researchers at the University of Washington have created algorithms based on
                hours of video footage and audio recordings to create realistic lip-synced videos of Barack Obama.</p>
